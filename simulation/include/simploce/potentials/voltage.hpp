     * reference point is where the electric potential is zero, such that v(z) may be interpreted as the
     * electric potential at z.
     * For a positive voltage (that is, the electric potential is increasing in the positive z-direction relative to
     * the reference point), a constant electric field is pointing towards the negative z-axis. The force
     * on a positively (negatively) charged particle is in the same (opposite) direction. The electric
     * field E(r) = -grad(v(r)) = E0.  Since E0 is constant, one must have v(z)=-E0.z.
